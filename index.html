        <h2> How do you handle component spacing in a design system?</h2>
        <p>Say you’ve got a
          *card *component. It’s highly likely it shouldn’t be butted right up against any other components with no
          spacing around it. That’s true for… pretty much every component. So, how do you handle component spacing in a
          design system?

        <h2> A whistle-stop tour of 4 new CSS color features</h2>
        <p>I was just writing in my <a href="">“What’s new in since CSS3?”</a> article about recent and possible future
          changes to CSS
          colors. It’s weirdly a lot. There are just as many or more new and upcoming ways to define colors than what we
          have now. I thought we’d take a really quick look.

          First, a major heads up. This stuff is so complicated. I barely understand it. But here are some aspects:

          Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB as a color model, and everything dealt with that.
          We had different “color spaces” that handled it differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that RGB color
          model as a cube with linear coordinates, the hsl() function mapped that RGB color model as a cylinder) but it
          was all sRGB gamut.
          With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color models and (!) we’re getting new functions that map that
          color model differently. So I think it’s kind of a double-triple whammy.

        <h2>Building an adaptive favicon</h2>
        <p>A custom
          <a href="">favicon</a> is a great way to polish a web project. It displays on desktop browser tabs, and also
          inside
          "save for later" readers, other blog posts linking to your site, and more. Traditionally this has been done
          with the .ico file type, but recently browsers have allowed use of <a href="">SVG</a>, a vector format.
